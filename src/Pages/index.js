/* This code snippet is using the ES6 module syntax to export multiple components from different files.
The `export { ... }` syntax is used to export named exports from a module. In this case, it is
exporting the components `Dashboard`, `Home`, `Loggin`, `Secret`, and `Signup` from their respective
files so that they can be imported and used in other parts of the application. */
